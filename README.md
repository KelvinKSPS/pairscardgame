# pairscardgame
Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Here's a sample code to make it using Java GUI. 

In this fork, I have converted to a maven project.

First, you need to run 
"mvn install"
to build the jar with dependences.

And then, run 
"java -jar target/pairscardgame-master-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar"
and enjoy the game.


The intention of forking this is for using to demonstrate SikuliX usage. More details will be added here.
